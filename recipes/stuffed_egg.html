    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Stuffed eggs, also known as deviled eggs, are a classic and versatile appetizer that features hard-boiled eggs with their yolks mixed with flavorful ingredients and then piped back into the egg whites. The filling often includes ingredients like mayonnaise, mustard, relish, and spices, creating a creamy, tangy, and slightly savory taste. They can be garnished with paprika, chives, or bacon bits to add extra flavor and visual appeal.
